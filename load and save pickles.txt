##Pickles
# save the model to disk
filename = '../models/[name]'
pickle.dump(model, open(filename, 'wb'))

# load the model from disk
loaded_model = pickle.load(open(filename, 'rb'))
result = loaded_model.score(X_test, Y_test)
print(result)

How to save and load a model
If you only have 10 seconds to read this guide, here's what you need to know.
